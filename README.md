# Redux Todo List

This is a Todo List built with React and Redux. It also uses local storage to persist the todo list. 

The default app has only the bar bones features: 

- creates todos
- removes todos
- saves todos

Your challenge is to some add new features. At the moment the app can add and remove todos. 

Take a quick look at the code and see what's there. 

- App 
	- NewTodo - Displays a simple form to add todos
	- ListTodos - Creates a list of todos
		- Todo - Displays a todo and a remove button (x)

The code here uses Hooks. 

- useState - react
- useSelector - react-redux
- useDispatch - react-redux
